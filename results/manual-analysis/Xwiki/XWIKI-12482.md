# Frame 1

## No improvement during the search
Best FF: 5.857142857142857 -> achieved on 1st generation.
it means that there is no improvement during the search.

## target method is private
- the target method call (isSelectExpressionAllowed) is private.
`isSelectExpressionAllowed (private) <- isSelectItemAllowed (private) <- isSafe (public)`
So, Evocrash tried to to reach to `isSelectExpressionAllowed` by calling `isSafe`.

## Evocrash got stuck in `isSafe`
it got stuck in line 140 of `HqlQueryUtils` class in method `isSafe`.
### reason:
in line 140 we have a call to a method `CCJSqlParserUtil` , which is imported to CUT.
Evocrash can not pass a proper input to this method. the input is `cleanedStatement` which is produced by some processes on `isSafe` input.

```diff
+  results are all the same in different rounds and different populations.
-  process is killed by observer on population 50 and 150.
```

# Frame 2

## No improvement during the search
there is no line coverage

## target method is private
- the target method call (isSelectItemAllowed) is private.
`isSelectItemAllowed (private) <- isSafe (public)`

## Evocrash got stuck in `isSafe` (same as frame 1)

Every thing is similar to frame 1, because the call which evocrash tried to inject to tests are the same (`isSafe`). Hence, it got stock in the same place (line 140) of this method for same reasons which are mentioned in Frame 1.

```diff
+  results are all the same in different rounds and different populations.
-  process is killed by observer on all of the populations.
```

# Frame 3

## No improvement during the search
there is no line coverage


## target method is `isSafe`
The problem is similar to frame 1. evocrash got stock on line 140 of `isSafe` for same reasons which are mentioned in Frame 1.

```diff
+  results are all the same in different rounds and different populations.
-  process is killed by observer on all of the populations.
```


# Frame 4
## line is covered between0 and 1000 evaluations
## ... But branch is not covered

![Alt text](screenshots/2.jpg?raw=true "XWIKI-12482")

the input of target method (`isSafeSelect`) is an string called `statementString`. this input is always generated in a way that makes HqlQueryUtils.isShortFormStatement(statementString) `true`. this event leads to a situation which we can not cover the targeet branch (`HqlQueryUtils.isSafe`) on the second part of the `||`

```diff
+  results are all the same in different rounds and different populations.
-  process is killed by observer on all of the populations.
```


# Frame 5

## Line is covered only in:
round 1 - POP100 : currentFitness: 0.4387755102040817
round 3 - POP100 : currentFitness: 3.0
round 4 - POP100 : currentFitness: 3.0
round 5 - POP100 : currentFitness: 0.4411764705882353
 **not in 2nd run**
the best FF is 0.4387755102040817. other runs needed more time to achieve to this amount of fitness function.
search got stock in a local optimum.

# Frame 6

## line is covered

there is a local optimum in next lines of target method. Evocrash got stock there.
best FF is 0.45


# Frame 7

## line is covered.
Evocrash got stock on the target line. can not set state of all of the variables in line 71 and 72.

# Frame 8

## line is covered.
## frame 7 is covered
it got stock there for similar reason that we had for frame 7.

# Frame 9

## line is covered.
## frame 8 and 7 is covered
it got stock there for similar reason that we had for frame 7.

# Frame 10

## line is covered
## frame 9 and 8  is covered in most of the rounds (in 3 out of 5 rounds).
Also, Frame 7 is covered in 2 out of 5 rounds .
it got stock there for similar reason that we had for frame 7.
