## Frame 1
Target method is private
The target method call (`isSelectExpressionAllowed`) is private.
`isSelectExpressionAllowed (private) <- isSelectItemAllowed (private) <- isSafe (public)`
So, Evocrash tried to to reach to `isSelectExpressionAllowed` by calling `isSafe`.
Evocrash got stuck in `isSafe`
It got stuck in line 140 of `HqlQueryUtils` class in method `isSafe`.
In line 140 we have a call to a method `CCJSqlParserUtil` , which is imported to CUT.
Evocrash can not pass a proper input to this method. the input is `cleanedStatement` which is produced by some processes on `isSafe` input.

```diff
+  results are all the same in different rounds and different populations.
-  process is killed by observer on population 50 and 150.
```

## Frame 2

EvoCrash cannot reach to the target line.
Target method is private.
The target method call (isSelectItemAllowed) is private.
`isSelectItemAllowed (private) <- isSafe (public)`
Evocrash got stuck in `isSafe` (same as frame 1)

Every thing is similar to frame 1, because the call which evocrash tried to inject to tests are the same (`isSafe`). Hence, it got stuck in the same place (line 140) of this method for same reasons which are mentioned in Frame 1.

## Frame 3
EvoCrash cannot reach to the target line.
Target method is `isSafe`
The problem is similar to frame 1. evocrash got stuck in line 140 of `isSafe` for same reasons which are mentioned in Frame 1.

## Frame 4
Target method line is reached.

![Alt text](screenshots/2.jpg?raw=true "XWIKI-12482")

The input of target method (`isSafeSelect`) is an string called `statementString`. this input is always generated in a way that makes HqlQueryUtils.isShortFormStatement(statementString) `true`. this event leads to a situation which we can not cover the targeet branch (`HqlQueryUtils.isSafe`) on the second part of the `||`


## Frame 5
Target line is reached in the majority of runs. The best FF is 0.4387755102040817. other runs needed more time to achieve to this amount of fitness function.
search got stuck in a local optimum because EvoCrash could not generate proper inputs.

## Frame 6

Target line is covered. There is a local optimum in next lines of target method. Evocrash got stuck there.
best FF is 0.45 because EvoCrash could not generate proper inputs.


## Frame 7

Target line is covered. Evocrash got stuck in the target line. can not set state of all of the variables in line 71 and 72.

## Frame 8
Target line of this frame is covered. however, Evocrash got stuck in the target line of frame 7 (for the same reason).

## Frame 9
Target line of this frame is covered. however, Evocrash got stuck in the target line of frame 7 (for the same reason).

## Frame 10
Target line of this frame is covered. however, Evocrash got stuck in the target line of frame 7 (for the same reason).
