## Frame 6
The target method is in a `try` block, followed by `catch(Exception e)`. Inside the catch block, a custom exception called `FetchPhaseExecutionException` is raised.
The target method has *141* lines of code.
Target line is not covered by EvoCrash tests.

## Frame 7
The target method has *79* lines of code. EvoCrash tests do not reach the target line through the generated input arguments.

## Frame 8
The target method has *80* lines of code. The tests from EvoCrash reach 1.5 line coverage, so the final fitness is 4.5
## Frame 9
The target method is private. EvoCrash found two public callers for this method: `executeQueryPhase` and `executeFetchPhase`. According to the stack trace, the first method call is the right one. However, usually the generated tests are throwing exceptions before even calling the public caller. It is because setting all of the variables to pass from the `<init>` without throwing any exception is hard.
## Frame 10
The target method is `executeQueryPhase` (discussed in the previous frame). The challenge is same as the one that we observed in the Frame 9.
## Frame 11
This frame points to an anonymous class which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 12
This frame points to the line where the anonymous class is defined in the previous frame. This frame is useless to crash reproduction.
## Frame 13
EvoCrash could not reach to the line coverage. It got stuck in line the following line in the target method:
```
final Task task = taskManager.register(channel.getChannelType(), action, request);
```
In this line, SUT calls method `getChannelType()` from one of the input arguments (`channel`). The type of this variable is `TransportChannel` which is an interface and there are lots of implementations. EvoCrash did not know which implementation is the right one. Even this information is not available in the stack  trace.
## Frame 14
Points to an anonymous class, not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 15
The target line is inside a private inner class. This is not supported by EvoSuite.
## Frame 16
The target class is abstract. In addition, the target line is inside a `try` block, followed by a `catch(Exception t)` block. If an exception occurs, it is signaled to other components. So no exception is thrown during program executions at this level.
```
    @Override
    public final void run() {
        try {
            doRun();
        } catch (Exception t) {
            onFailure(t);
        } finally {
            onAfter();
        }
    }
```
