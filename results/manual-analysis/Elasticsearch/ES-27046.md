## Frame 1
EvoCrash could not reach to the target line. The target method has more than 200 lines of code.
## Frame 2
This frame points to the same class as frame 1. Same results.
The target line is in an anonymous class, which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 3
This frame points to the same class as frame 1. Same results.
In addition, this frame points to the line where the anonymous class in the previous frame is define. This frame is useless for crash reproduction with EvoCrash.
## Frame 4
This frame points to an abstract class.
## Frame 5
This frame points to an abstract class.
The target method is an error handler as the following:
```
    @Override
    public final void onResponse(Response response) {
        try {
            processResponse(response);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            onFailure(e);
        }
    }
```
Therefore, no exception would be thrown at this level. Exceptions are signaled instead.
## Frame 6
This frame points to an anonymous class which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 7
This frame points to where the anonymous class is defined in the previous frame. This frame is useless for crash reproduction with Evocrash.
## Frame 8
Evocrash could not find any generator for the cut. So, it could not test it. CUT is an abstract class.
## Frame 9
This frame points to the same abstract class as the one in frame 8.
This method is a wrapper. Similarly, the class is not loaded successfully for this frame either.
## Frame 10
This frame points to the same abstract class as the one in frame 8.
The target method is private. The target line is inside a `try` block. No exception is thrown at this level, but if they occur, they are signaled.
## Frame 11
EvoCrash achieves to fitness value lower than 1.0. It means that the line and exception is covered. However, According to the execution logs, we can see that in the best case EvoCrash throws NPE in the target line. EvoCrash got stuck in the local optima there and it could not generate more complex input to pass that.
## Frame 12
This frame uses lambdas, which are not supported.
## Frame 13
This frame points to an anonymous class, which is not supported.
## Frame 14 & 15 & 16
EvoSuite has no generator for `org.elasticsearch.transport.TcpTransport`, and it could not be mocked. This class is an **abstract class**, and EvoCrash could not find the implementation of it.

## Frame 17
EvoCrash threw NullPointerException in the `<init>` of cut. it could not generate the proper input arguments.
