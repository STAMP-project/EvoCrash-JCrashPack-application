## Frame 1
The target method has *204* lines of code. EvoCrash fails when analyzing the classpath.
## Frame 2
This frame points to the same class as frame 1. Same results.
The target line is in an anonymous class, which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 3
This frame points to the same class as frame 1. Same results.
In addition, this frame points to the line where the anonymous class in the previous frame is define. This frame is useless for crash reproduction with EvoCrash.
## Frame 4
The target class is abstract. EvoCrash fails when analyzing the classpath with `Error while initializing target class: org.apache.logging.log4j.spi.Provider: Provider org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.Log4jProvider not a subtype`
## Frame 5
This frame points to an abstract class.
The target method is an error handler as the following:
```
    @Override
    public final void onResponse(Response response) {
        try {
            processResponse(response);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            onFailure(e);
        }
    }
```
Therefore, no exception would be thrown at this level. Exceptions are signaled instead.
## Frame 6
This frame points to an anonymous class which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 7
This frame points to where the anonymous class is defined in the previous frame. This frame is useless for crash reproduction with Evocrash.
## Frame 8
This frame points to an abstract class. The target method is inside a nested protected class, which is not supported.
In addition, the target line is inside a `try` block as follows:
```
 try {
     listener.onResponse(response);
} catch (Exception e) {
     listener.onFailure(e);
}
```
Therefore, no exception is thrown at this level. Exeptions would be signaled in case they occur.
The class is not loaded successfully. EvoCrash fails.
## Frame 9
This frame points to the same abstract class as the one in frame 8.
This method is a wrapper. Similarly, the class is not loaded successfully for this frame either.
## Frame 10
This frame points to the same abstract class as the one in frame 8.
The target method is private. The target line is inside a `try` block. No exception is thrown at this level, but if they occur, they are signaled.
## Frame 11
The target line is inside a public static inner class. This class is not loaded successfully.
## Frame 12
This frame uses lambdas, which are not supported.
## Frame 13
This frame points to an anonymous class, which is not supported.
## Frame 14
The target class is static. Lambdas are used in the target line, which are not supported.
## Frame 15
The target method is a private error handler which reads an exception and calls a handler.
```
    private void handlerResponseError(StreamInput stream, final TransportResponseHandler handler) {
        Exception error;
        try {
            error = stream.readException();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            error = new TransportSerializationException("Failed to deserialize exception response from stream", e);
        }
        handleException(handler, error);
    }
```
The target class is not loaded successfully.
## Frame 16
The target method has *76* lines of code. It is a complex method. The target class is not loaded successfully.
