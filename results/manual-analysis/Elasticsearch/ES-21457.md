## Frame 1
EvoCrash made it 2 times out of 5.
The target line is reached when `frozen.get() == Boolen.TRUE` as the following shows:

```
    protected void failIfFrozen() {
        this.cachable = false;
        if (frozen.get() == Boolean.TRUE) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("features that prevent cachability are disabled on this context");
        } else {
            assert frozen.get() == null : frozen.get();
        }
    }
```

## Frame 2
EvoCrash tests cover the taret line every time.

The method at this level is a wrapper, as shown below:
```
    public long nowInMillis() {
        failIfFrozen();
        return nowInMillis.getAsLong();
    }
```

## Frame 3
static initialization is involved in the class. So this class would not be loaded.

## Frame 4
EvoCrash reached 4.8 4 times out of 5, and crashed once.
The target line is inside a nested `for` loop, as shown below:
```
    public long nowInMillis() {
        failIfFrozen();
        return nowInMillis.getAsLong();
    }
```

## Frame 5
EvoCrash crashed every time.
The target call is private. So EvoCrash makes a call to `execute` which is the only public method in the class that calls the target. `execute` has 87 lines of code with lots of ifs and loops.

## Frame 6
EvoCrash crashes every time. This method makes a call to the private call in frame 5.

## Frame 7
EvoCrash cannot finish the initialization of the target class without throwing any exception. EvoCrash cannot set the variables, which are used in the `<init>`, properly.
## Frame 8
This frame points to a lambda expression, which is not supported by EvoSuite yet. EvoCrash crashes every time.
## Frame 9
The target frame points to an interface. EvoCrash failed every time.
```java
public interface TransportRequestHandler<T extends TransportRequest> {

    /**
     * Override this method if access to the Task parameter is needed
     */
    default void messageReceived(final T request, final TransportChannel channel, Task task) throws Exception {
        messageReceived(request, channel);
    }

    void messageReceived(T request, TransportChannel channel) throws Exception;
}
```
## Frame 10
Guided initialization in EvoCrash failed every time. CUT has static inner class.
## Frame 11
The target line is inside a `try` block, followed by `catch(Exception e)`. Therefore, the target exception would not be thrown in the program execution.

The target method is in an anonymous class, which is not supported. EvoCrash fails.

## Frame 12
The target line is inside a private inner class. EvoCrash fails every time.
## Frame 13
The target class is abstract, with missing implementations. Therefore, execution terminates.
## Frame 14-16
Java packages, which are irrelevant to the experiment.
