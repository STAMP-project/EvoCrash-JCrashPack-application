java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: unknown setting [cluster.routing.allocation.same_shard.host] did you mean any of [cluster.routing.allocation.balance.shard, cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold, cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high, cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low, cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node]?

## Frame 1
`org.elasticsearch.common.settings.AbstractScopedSettings` points to an abstract class. EvoCrash has crashed 5 times at this level, due to "Error while initializing target class: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError".

## Frame 2

Same as frame level 1.
In addition, the target line is inside a try block, as follows:
```
   try {
        validate(entry.getKey(), settings);
   } catch (RuntimeException ex) {
        exceptions.add(ex);
   }
```
So even if EvoCrash would not crash, no exception would be thrown at this level!

## Frame 3
EvoCrash crashed once, and 4 times the fitness reached 4.5.
The target call has 79 lines of code, with several `for` loops and 1 `if` statement.

## Frame 4
The target call has 123 lines of code. EvoCrash cannot achieve to the target line.

## Frame 5
This frame is a wrapper constructor. EvoCrash crashes.

## Frame 6
Points to an anonymous class. EvoCrash crashes.
# Frame 7 & 8
EvoCrash cannot start the search because it cannot find a public target method. The `init()` is package-private and it can be invoked by the other methods and tests in the same package. However, EvoCrash find it private.
## Frame 9
The target class is not public. The target line is in a `try` block, followed by a `catch(final Throwable t)`. EvoCrash crashes every time, because `guided initialization` fails.

However, even if not, the target exception would not be thrown at this level!

## Frame 10
EvoCrash can achieve to the target line. The problem is setting the proper state for the deeper frames.
## Frame 11
EvoCrash failed every time because guided initialization failed. The target class and target method is abstarct in this frame.
# Frame 12
The target method is **package-private**. EvoCrash detects it as a private method. it searches for other public caller in this method which it can find it. but, as we can see in the stack trace, it is not the right path for crash reproduction.

# Frame 13
Challenge is in the deeper frame.
## Frame 14 & 15
EvoCrash can achieve to the target line. It can even achieve to the target line of frame 9. However, it cannot continue the right path because it could not set the proper values for the variables on that level.
