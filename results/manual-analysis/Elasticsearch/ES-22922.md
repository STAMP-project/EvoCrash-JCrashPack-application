## Frame 1 & 2
Target method of frame 1 is private, and its public caller is the target method of frame 2. EvoCrash can achieve to the target line of frame 2, but it is not successful for target line of frame 1. It cannot set the variables of the CUT, properly.

## Frame 3
Target class is abstract. EvoCrash could not find the right extension.

# Frame 4 & 6
The target method is **package-private**. EvoCrash detects it as a private method. it searches for other public caller in this method which it can find it. but, as we can see in the stack trace, it is not the right path for crash reproduction.

# Frame 5
EvoCrash got stuck in line 59. For passing this line, it should set a proper value for one of the local variables.

# Frame 7
Challenge is in the deeper frame.

# Frame 8
EvoCrash cannot set the proper input values.
