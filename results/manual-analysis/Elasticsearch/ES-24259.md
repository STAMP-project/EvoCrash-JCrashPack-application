## Frame 1
EvoCrash reached to the target line. But it cannot throw any exception in this line because this line is surrounded by try catch.
## Frame 2
EvoCrash crashed because target frame point to an anonymous class.
## Frame 3
This frame points to an abstract class. EvoCrash uses `LeafBucketCollectorBase` which extends this abstract. The generated trace does not look fully similar, therefore fitness never becomes 0.0.

## Frame 10
The target method has *286* lines of code. EvoCrash does not reach the target line!
## Frame 11
Line is reached. Problem is same as the deeper frame.

## Frame 12 & 13
Initization of the target class is hard. EvoCrash cannot set the value of all variables properly.

## Frame 14
The target method is inside an anonymous class, which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 15
This frame points to the line where the anonymous class in frame 14 is defined. This is a useless frame for crash reproduction.
## Frame 16
Guided initialization in EvoCrash failed every time. CUT has static inner class.
## Frame 17
The target method is inside an anonymous class.
## Frame 18
The target line is inside a private nested class which is not supported by EvoSuite.
## Frame 19
The target frame is an abstract class. EvoCrash uses an implementation which extends this abstract. The generated stack is never the same as the original one.
