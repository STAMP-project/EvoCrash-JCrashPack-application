## Frame 1
This frame points to an internal package which interacts wit the core package. The target class could not be initialized, so EvoCrash failed every time.
## Frame 2
EvoCrash crashed.
## Frame 3
This frame points to an abstract class. EvoCrash uses `LeafBucketCollectorBase` which extends this abstract. The generated trace does not look fully similar, therefore fitness never becomes 0.0.
## Frame 4-9
The packages belong to Apache Lucene. Not used in the experiment!
## Frame 10
The target method has *286* lines of code. EvoCrash does not reach the target line!
## Frame 11
Line is not covered in 4 rounds out of 5.
## Frame 12
The target method is private. The public caller is `executeQueryPhase`, which has a `try` block inside which the target method is called.
Guided initialization fails every time.
## Frame 13
This frame points to the public caller which is referred to in frame 12.
## Frame 14
The target method has *115* lines of code.
The target method is inside an anonymous class, which is not supported by EvoCrash.
## Frame 15
This frame points to the line where the anonymous class in frame 14 is defined. This is a useless frame for crash reproduction.
## Frame 16
Guided initialization fails at this level.
## Frame 17
The target method is inside an anonymous class, which is inside a `try` block, followed by a `catch(Exception e)` block. An exception could not be raised at this level.
The target method is private.
## Frame 18
The target line is inside a private nested class which is not supported by EvoSuite.
## Frame 19
The target frame is an abstract class. EvoCrash uses an implementation which extends this abstract. The generated stack is never the same as the original one.
The target line is inside a `try` block. An exception could not be raised at this level.
