## Frame 1
Guided initialization fails.
## Frame 2-3
These frames point to packages from Apache Lucene. They are not used in the experiment.
## Frame 4
The target method has 119 lines of code. EvoCrash does not reach the line.
## Frame 5
The target method has 69 lines of code. EvoCrash does not reach the line.
## Frame 6
The target method has 100 lines of code. EvoCrash does not reach the line.
## Frame 7
The target method is inside a `try` block, followed by a `catch(Throwable e)` block. Therefore, the target exception would not be thrown in program executions.
Guided initialization failed in EvoCrash every time.
## Frame 8
The target line is in a non-public class, which was not reached every time.
```
    class SearchQueryFetchTransportHandler extends TransportRequestHandler<ShardSearchTransportRequest> {
        @Override
        public void messageReceived(ShardSearchTransportRequest request, TransportChannel channel) throws Exception {
            QueryFetchSearchResult result = searchService.executeFetchPhase(request);
            channel.sendResponse(result);
        }
    }
```
## Frame 9
Points to the line where the class in frame 8 is defined. This frame is useless for crash reproduction.
## Frame 10
The target class is abstract. Therefore, EvoCrash uses an implementation of the abstract class, called `TransportLivenessAction`:
```
    @Override
    public void messageReceived(LivenessRequest request, TransportChannel channel) throws Exception {
        channel.sendResponse(new LivenessResponse(clusterName, clusterService.localNode()));
    }
```
Fitness never becomes 0.0 when frames point to abstract classes.
## Frame 11
Guided initialization failed every time.
## Frame 12
The target method is private and inside a `try` block, followed by `catch(Throwable e)`. Therefore, the target exception would never be thrown in program executions.
The target method is inside an anonymous class, therefore EvoCrash failed every time.
## Frame 13
The target method is inside a `try` block followed by a `catch(Throwable t)`. Therefore the target exception is never thrown in program executions.
```
    @Override
    public final void run() {
        try {
            doRun();
        } catch (Throwable t) {
            onFailure(t);
        } finally {
            onAfter();
        }
    }
```

In addition, the target class is abstract, so EvoCrash uses an implementation called `TranslogBasedFlush`, which is inside `TranslogService.java`
