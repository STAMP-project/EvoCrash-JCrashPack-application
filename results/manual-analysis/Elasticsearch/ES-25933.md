## Frame 1 & 2 & 3
Target method of frames 1 and 2 are privates and their public caller is `coordinates` (target method of frame 3).
EvoCrash could not reach to the target line of frame 3 because it cannot set all of the variables of the cut properly.

## Frame 4
CUT `MultiPolygonBuilder` cannot be initilized by EvoCrash without throwing any exception because it is hard for EvoCrash to set all of the variables of the cut properly.

## Frame 5
CUT `GeoShapeFieldMapper` cannot be initilized by EvoCrash without throwing any exception because it is hard for EvoCrash to set all of the variables of the cut properly.
